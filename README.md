## 📌 Project Overview

This repository includes step-by-step Jupyter notebooks designed to help you understand fundamental data processing and classical machine learning workflows:

1. **Study of Anaconda IDE and Its Installation** – Setting up Python environment via Anaconda, launching Jupyter.  
2. **Creation of Array** – Learning NumPy basics: array creation, manipulation, indexing.  
3. **Data Acquisition** – Loading datasets from files or URLs using Pandas.  
4. **Data Manipulation** – Wrangling and transforming data via filtering, grouping, merging.  
5. **Missing Value Treatment** – Identifying and handling NaNs (drop vs impute strategies).  
6. **Statistical Description** – Computing descriptive statistics: mean, median, variance, percentiles.  
7. **Central Tendency of Measures** – Understanding mean, median, mode and their appropriate usage.  
8. **Data Visualization** – Plotting histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
9. **Simple Linear Regression** – Modeling relationships, regression metrics (R², MSE), residual plots.  
10. **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC analysis.  
11. **KNN (K Nearest Neighbour)** – Distance metrics, selecting ‘k’, train-test evaluation.  
12. **SVM Classifier** – Applying SVM with linear & RBF kernels, tuning hyperparameters.
